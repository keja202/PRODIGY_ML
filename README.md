🌟 Overview
During my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I undertook two impactful projects that allowed me to apply machine learning techniques in practical scenarios. Each project showcases distinct methodologies and enhances my understanding of machine learning applications.

💻 Projects
1. Cat vs. Dog Classification using SVM
Objective: Create a model to classify images of cats and dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.
Highlights:
Data collection and preprocessing techniques for image datasets.
Implementation of SVM for effective classification.
Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
2. House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Objective: Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features.
Highlights:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features influencing house prices.
Application of Linear Regression for price predictions.
Visualization of results to understand model performance and predictions.
