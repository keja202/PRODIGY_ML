üíª **Projects**
1. **Cat vs. Dog Classification using SVM**
   - **Objective:** Create a model to classify images of cats and dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.
   - **Highlights:**
     - Data collection and preprocessing techniques for image datasets.
     - Implementation of SVM for effective classification.
     - Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

2. **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
   - **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features.
   - **Highlights:**
     - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features influencing house prices.
     - Application of Linear Regression for price predictions.
     - Visualization of results to understand model performance and predictions.
